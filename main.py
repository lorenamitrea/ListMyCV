#REQ

"""
Please write a Python Flask application that presents your CV data:

As a JSON REST API with endpoints GET /personal, GET /experience, GET /education, ...
As a Flask CLI command that prints the data to the console
The CV data can be hard-coded in the code or read from disk. You do not need to integrate with any database.
Please include a README file on how to start the REST API and how to execute the CLI command.

It’s not a problem if you do not manage to get to a working version.
 Just send us the code you’ve written and describe the issue that is blocking you.
